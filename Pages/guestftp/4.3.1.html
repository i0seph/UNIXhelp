<H1>The <SAMP>hash</SAMP> command</H1>

<P>To monitor the progress of a transfer, it can be  useful  to
enter  the hash command before the transfer.  This instructs
ftp to print a `#' character for every 1024  bytes  of  data
received.  So long as a # appears every so often, the ftp is
still in progress, and there are no problems.</P>

<P>The file transferred in this  example  was  15788  bytes  in
length,  which  with communication overheads was transferred
in 16494 bytes. This causes 17 # marks to be printed.</P>
