<H1>Initiating Transfers on Your Local Machine</H1>

<P>This is the preferred method of transferring  files  to  and
from  uk.ac.nsf.sun.   We  strongly encourage you adopt this
method, since it is almost certain to be the fastest.</P>

<P>Since there are a variety of  machines  on  JANET,  you  are
advised  to check with your Computing Services as to how the
file transfer software on the machine you are  using  works.</P>

<P>In  general,  on  Unix machines the transfer command will be
<STRONG><A HREF="../tasks/ftp3.html">hhcp</A></STRONG> or <STRONG>cpf</STRONG>.
On VAX/VMS systems,  the  command  is  usually called <STRONG>transfer</STRONG>.</P>
