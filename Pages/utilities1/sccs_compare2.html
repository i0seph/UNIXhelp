<H1>Examples of comparing files with the <SAMP>sccsdiff</SAMP> command</H1>

<P>To compare two versions of the same SCCS file:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>/usr/sccs/sccsdiff -r1.3 -r1.5 s.foo.c</STRONG>
   SCCS/s.foo.c: 1.3 vs. 1.5
   21c21
   &lt;  static char exname[] = "Template Xternals";
   ---
   &gt;  static char exname[] = "Template XTernals";
</PRE>

<P>This displays a line by line difference between versions
<SAMP>1.3</SAMP> and <SAMP>1.5</SAMP> of the SCCS file <SAMP>s.foo.c</SAMP>
which is in the current directory.</P>

<P>The two versions of this file differ at line 21, where the
variable name has been changed from <SAMP>Xternals</SAMP> to 
<SAMP>XTernals</SAMP>.</P>

<P>To compare two versions of two or more SCCS files:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>/usr/sccs/sccsdiff -r1.2 -r1.3 s.part[1-3].c</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This displays a line by line difference between versions<SAMP>1.2</SAMP>
and <SAMP>1.3</SAMP> of the SCCS files <SAMP>s.part1.c</SAMP> through 
<SAMP>s.part3.c</SAMP> which are in the current directory.</P>
